  - The Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to our results, ground clearance and vehicle_weight (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.
  - The slope of the linear model is not zero. The p-value (7.712e-11) is smaller than the assumed significance level (0.05%). Thus we can reject the null hypothesis.
  - The linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. According to the R-squared value (0.7119), this shows that 71.19% of the variations in mpg can be explained by the changes of other variables.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:
  - From the total summary, the variance is 62.29356 which is lower than 100 pounds per square inch. Thus meets the design specification (in total).

  - From the lot summary, lot 1 and 2 meets the specification while lot 3 has a high variance (170.2861224), which does not meet the design specification.

##  T-Tests on Suspension Coils:
  - The p-value for all lots is 0.06028 which is greater than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  - The p-value for lot 1 is 1 which is greater than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  - The p-value for lot 2 is 0.6072 which is greater than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
